## 📈 Data-Driven Innovation

I believe in rigorous testing and optimization. My approach includes:

- Precision, Recall, and F1-score evaluations for model performance.
- Advanced filter comparisons (Chebyshev, Butterworth, Wavelets, etc.).
- Real-time PSD & topograph visualizations for EEG data analysis.

## ❤️ Fun Facts

- 🌊 I live near the sea, so humidity is always a factor in my hardware designs.
- 💾 I built a custom NAS with Radxa SATA HATs, SSDs, and HDDs for ultimate data control.
- 🧠 I can break down neural networks using flip-flops and logic gates.
- 🖼️ My enclosures are SCAD-modeled and STL-ready, often with sleek sliding lids.
- 🛠️ I slice PETG at 24 mm³/s and treat TPU drying like a science experiment.

## 💬 Let's Connect!

I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and tech discussions. I communicate in Hebrew, English, and a touch of French (with an accent for flair). Catch me optimizing inference speeds, debugging logs, or designing 3D parts on a Sunday night.

- 📧 Drop me a message or open an issue on any repo.
- 🤝 Let's build something amazing together!
