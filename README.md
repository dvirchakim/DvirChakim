# Hi there, I'm Dvir Chakim! 👋

## 🧠 Embedded Innovator | 🎛️ AI at the Edge | 🇮🇱 Based in Israel

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an electrical engineering student and a tech enthusiast on a mission to bring intelligence to the edge — literally.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems**: Working with Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Orange Pi, Portenta X8, Nicla Voice, and more.
- 🤖 **AI/ML at the Edge**: Deploying local models for speech recognition, image classification, wake-word detection, and real-time decision-making.
- 📦 **Dockerized Pipelines**: I keep it clean with containerized STT, TTS, LLM models running on low-power boards.
- 🌐 **Self-Hosted IoT Networks**: ChirpStack, MQTT, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana, and custom dashboards are my playground.
- 🎤 **Voice Assistants**: Building offline AI assistants that listen, think, and speak — no cloud needed.

## ⚡ Tech I Love

- **Languages**: Python, C/C++, Bash  
- **Platforms**: Arduino, STM32, Edge Impulse, Ubuntu, Proxmox, Yocto  
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, VSCode, Klipper, Mainsail  
- **AI Accelerators**: DeepX M1, Hailo8, Axelera Metis, NVIDIA Jetson, Alif Ensemble

## 🔬 Ongoing Projects

- A humanoid robot with local voice interface and environmental awareness  
- AI-powered 3D printer monitor to stop failed prints in real time  
- RF signal classification using SDR and neural networks  
- Dust, gas, and motion sensor suite with LoRa and Bluetooth sleep/wake logic  
- Frigate-based smart camera server running on Jetson Nano  
- Fully self-hosted voice assistant using Portenta X8 with Dockerized STT → LLM → TTS

## 📈 Data-Driven by Design

I don't just run models — I test them. I use:

- Precision / Recall / F1-score evaluations  
- Filter comparisons (Chebyshev, Butterworth, Wavelets, etc.)  
- Real-time PSD & topograph visualizations with EEG data

---

## ❤️ Random Facts

- I live near the sea — so yes, humidity is always in the equation  
- I built my own NAS with Radxa SATA HATs, SSDs, and HDDs for data love  
- I can explain neural nets with flip-flops and logic gates  
- My enclosures are SCAD-modeled and STL-ready with sliding lids  
- Sometimes I slice PETG at 24 mm³/s and dry TPU like a chemist

---

## 💬 Let's Connect!

- Always open to collaboration, feedback, and geeky convos!  
- Hebrew, English, and a bit of French accent — just for fun  
- You'll usually find me deep in logs, optimizing inference speeds, or designing 3D parts on a Sunday night
